### Fredrik Bille
^Name is stated above^
I am a student of computer science at zealand school of applied sciences. i just started this fall after a five year sabatical due to personal reasons. My hobbies might seem very stereotypical of any pc related education, cause we game, we nerd, we obsess and im looking forward to expanding the nerding spektrume while making some money on top of it.

Currently my days are spent learning a new craft, that is programming and pass my freetime by looking at funny pictures and reposting them as funny reactions to others. trying to keep a healthy circle og laughter between my friendsgroup and classmates. other antics would a bit of iceskating coupled with the gravity excersises that follows!

Before

As mentioned i took a 5 year sabaticle, it was planned to only keep me busy for a years time, but having money, picking working hours
and having a sweet working enviroment you tend to fall into habbits. Which i am terrible at changing.
